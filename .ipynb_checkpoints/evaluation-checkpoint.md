# Testing Claude as a Cooking Tutor: Learning to Make Lomo Saltado

## Overview

This project explores how structured prompting affects the quality and effectiveness of LLM-based tutoring. I conducted two tutoring sessions where I learned to cook Peruvian lomo saltado using locally available Philadelphia ingredients. The first session used a vanilla (unstructured) chat approach, while the second session used the Mollick structured tutoring prompt. By comparing these sessions, I evaluated how different prompting strategies influence an LLM's ability to provide clear guidance, maintain student engagement, and adapt to distraction techniques.

## Contents

* **session_1_unstructured.md** - First tutoring session with no structured prompt. The LLM responded naturally to my request to be a cooking tutor with no special instructions.

* **session_2_structured.md** - Second tutoring session using the Mollick structured tutoring prompt to guide the LLM's behavior and communication style.

* **evaluation.md** - Analysis comparing the three sessions, including subjective experience, observations on tutoring communication, and effectiveness of each approach.
