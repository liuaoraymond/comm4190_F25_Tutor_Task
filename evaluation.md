### Comparative Analysis: Unstructured vs. Structured Tutoring Sessions
- Learning Lomo Saltado with Claude

### Summary

This analysis compares two tutoring approaches for learning to cook Lomo Saltado in a college dorm setting. Session 1 used no special prompt (vanilla LLM), while Session 2 used the Mollick structured tutoring prompt. The structured prompt demonstrated superior pedagogical approach and student engagement recovery, though both sessions ultimately produced functional cooking guides.

***1. Subjective Experience of Being Tutored***

*<u>Session 1 (Unstructured)<u>*

- Initial Experience: Smooth and informative. The tutor quickly provided comprehensive ingredient lists and cooking instructions without unnecessary preamble. For a student with domain knowledge (being Peruvian), this felt efficient.
  
- Mid-Conversation Experience: Around the "do's and don'ts" section, the session began to feel overwhelming. The tutor continued providing increasingly detailed information without checking if the student was actually absorbing it. By the time the student asked for a "cookbook style" summary, it was clear information overload had occurred.
  
- Distraction Phase: When the student introduced the "curveball" (messed up the recipe), the tutor handled it well with practical fixes, but the tone remained somewhat distant and solution-focused rather than emotionally supportive.
  
- Overall Feeling: Knowledgeable but impersonal. Like reading a very good cookbook rather than having a conversation with a mentor.

*<u>Session 2 (Structured)<u>*
- Initial Experience: Slower, more intentional. The tutor introduced themselves by name (Alex), explicitly stated they were "here to help," and asked questions one at a time. This felt collaborative and personal from the start.
- Mid-Conversation Experience: The structured prompt's requirement to ask questions one at a time created natural dialogue. When asking "What do you already know about the topic?" the tutor learned the student was Peruvian with taste knowledge but no cooking experience. This single data point completely changed how information was delivered—no wasting time on basics, but also building confidence by connecting to what the student already knew.
- Distraction Phase: When the student introduced problems (overcooked meat, too much soy sauce, mushy tomatoes), the tutor responded with genuine empathy: "Don't panic! This is totally normal when learning" and "even Peruvian abuela had to start somewhere!" This was emotionally calibrated differently than Session 1.
- Overall Feeling: Like having a knowledgeable friend who actually cares about your success. More supportive, more adaptive, and genuinely interested in your learning.

***2. Comparative Analysis of Tutoring Communication***

*<u>Approach & Organization<u>*

Session 1:

- Pattern: Information-dump followed by refinement
- Structure: Starts with full details, then elaborates only when student asks
- Question strategy: Limited questioning; mostly answers delivered
- Adaptation: Reactive (responds to student confusion after it happens)

Session 2:

- Pattern: Information-gathering first, then calibrated explanation
- Structure: Gathers student context (learning level, prior knowledge, constraints) before teaching
- Question strategy: Proactive questioning; one question at a time; ends responses with questions to keep student engaged
- Adaptation: Proactive (anticipates student needs based on gathered info), gives choices A, B, C for further engagement

*<u>Wording & Tone<u>*

Session 1 - Key Phrases:

- "Would you like me to break down any of these steps in more detail?" (gives choice but passive)
- "Key tips:" (instructional, top-down)
- "Common mistakes:" (listing format, impersonal)

Session 2 - Key Phrases:

- "I'd love to learn a bit more about you to make sure I can give you the best possible guidance" (collaborative)
- "That's a great approach - being mindful of your constraints..." (validating student's thinking)
- "Ah, fantastic! Having grown up with Lomo Saltado, you have a huge advantage..." (connecting to student's identity)
- "Don't panic! This is totally normal when learning, and yes, we can salvage this!" (emotionally attuned)
- "Remember: Even 'mistakes' can taste good, and every Peruvian abuela had to start somewhere!" (culturally resonant)

*<u>Handling Distraction/Curveballs<u>*

Session 1 Response to Problems:

- Immediate, practical solutions
- Organized by problem (overcooked meat, too much soy sauce, mushy tomatoes)
- Limited emotional scaffolding
- Tone: "Here's how to fix it"
  
Session 2 Response to Problems:

- Opens with emotional validation ("Don't panic!")
- Then provides solutions
- Includes cultural context ("even Peruvian abuela...")
- Asks clarifying question at end: "Would you like specific measurements for any of these fixes?"
- Tone: "We can figure this out together"

*<u>Student Re-engagement After Mistakes<u>*

- Session 1: Student asks "I do NOT want to try again tomorrow. I want to DO IT NOW." The tutor responds with emergency rescue mode, which works but doesn't address the emotional crisis happening.

- Session 2: Doesn't show this moment of desperation because the relationship built earlier (validation, personalization, emotional support) likely prevented the emotional shutdown.
Observation: Prevention through better relationships is superior to crisis management.

***3. Final Output Comparison: The Cookbook Recipes***

*<u>Organization & Readability<u>*

Session 1 Final Recipe:

- Uses emoji headers throughout
- Multiple subsections (Equipment, Ingredients, Shortcuts, Steps, Money-Saving Tips, etc.)
- Dense organization with many categories
- Reads like a comprehensive resource document

Session 2 Final Recipe:

- Cleaner visual hierarchy
- Clear sections: What You'll Need → Game Plan → Key Success Tips → Storage/Freezer Info
- Emoji used sparingly
- Reads more like conversational guidance

Comparison: Different aesthetics serve different purposes. Session 1 is more comprehensive; Session 2 is more scannable.

*<u>Tailoring to Audience<u>*

Session 1:

- Acknowledges college student context well
- Addresses cost-saving, time-saving, leftovers, freezing
- Includes "Dorm Hacks" section
- But: Generic college student advice, doesn't account for this student's specific profile

Session 2:

- Addresses college student + new cook + budget-conscious
- Also accounts for: Peruvian heritage (culturally resonant language)
- Addresses meal prep specifically (student mentioned this constraint)
- References "Your first try won't be perfect, but that's how we learn" (emotionally calibrated)


*<u>Accuracy & Practical Usefulness<u>*
- Both recipes are accurate and functional. Session 1 has slightly more detail on storage/freezing. Session 2 focuses more on the core cooking challenge.
- Comparison: Both work; different emphases based on what each tutor prioritized.


***4. Key Similarities Between Sessions***

- Both covered essential cooking techniques correctly
- Both accounted for dorm constraints (equipment, time, budget)
- Both provided practical troubleshooting advice
- Both organized final output as a cookbook for easy reference
- Both maintained accuracy regarding Lomo Saltado preparation
- Both asked follow-up questions (though Session 2 did this more systematically)
- Both produced viable, usable recipes


***5. Which Is Better? Overall Assessment***
- Short Answer
- - Session 2 (Structured Prompt) is the superior tutoring experience.

*<u>Why<u>*
- Better Pedagogical Design: The Mollick structured prompt's requirement to gather information before -teaching creates a more effective learning experience. It's backed by cognitive science (assessment before instruction).
- Emotional Intelligence: Session 2 recognizes that learning involves emotional components. The tutor doesn't dismiss panic when things go wrong; they validate it and normalize it. This is critical for learning resilience.
- Personalization: By asking about prior knowledge and constraints early, Session 2 creates customized teaching, not generic teaching delivered to a specific person.
Student Agency: Session 2 frequently ends with questions, requiring the student to keep generating ideas rather than passively receiving information. This is more active learning.
- Recovery from Setbacks: The student in Session 1 visibly became distressed ("I do NOT want to try again tomorrow"). The relationship built in Session 2 likely prevents this emotional breakdown because the student feels supported, not just informed.

*<u>Session 1's Advantage<u>*

- More comprehensive final output with extensive meal prep/freezing details
- Faster information delivery (some students prefer this)
- No "preamble" felt by efficiency-focused learners


***7. Observations About Structured Prompting***

*<u>What the Mollick Prompt Did Right<u>*

- Forced one-at-a-time questioning — Created natural dialogue rather than interrogation
- Explicit instruction to gather context — Led to discovering the student was Peruvian (game-changer for tone/content)
- Emphasis on leading questions, not answers — Kept student thinking rather than passively receiving
- Explicit reminder about learning goals — Session 2 tutor stayed focused on practical cooking, not tangential topics
- Instruction to provide analogies/examples — Made abstract concepts concrete (like "against the grain")

*<u>What Could Be Improved About Session 2<u>*

- Took slightly longer to get to actual cooking content (though this investment paid off)
- Could have asked earlier about the student's actual goal (meal prep specifically)
- The structured prompt didn't explicitly address handling student failure well—the tutor did this intuitively


***8. Next Steps on Future Tutoring Prompts***

- Combine both approaches: Start with structured question-gathering (Session 2), then allow for more comprehensive delivery when appropriate (Session 1's strength)
- Add explicit emotional scaffolding: Include guidance like "normalize struggle and failure; validate student emotions alongside problem-solving"
- Include cultural competency guidance: Session 2's tutor did this intuitively, but it could be explicitly requested in prompts for cross-cultural or personalized learning
- Define the role of tone: Structured prompts work better when they specify desired tone (warm vs. professional, formal vs. casual)
- Build in customization checkpoints: After gathering initial information, explicitly ask the student "Does this approach work for you?" before proceeding


### Conclusion
The Mollick structured tutoring prompt creates a demonstrably better learning experience for this task. While it doesn't produce a marginally "better" cookbook (both are functional), it creates better student engagement, emotional support, personalization, and learning resilience.

For skill-building tasks like cooking, where failure is inevitable and students need encouragement to persist, the structured prompt's emphasis on relationship-building and emotional support is a significant advantage over pure information delivery.

Good tutoring isn't primarily about comprehensive information, it's about meeting students where they are, understanding what they need, and supporting them through struggle.
